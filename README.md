# Hybrid Cloud Minecraft Infrastructure

This project deploys a secure, Minecraft server using a Hybrid Cloud Architecture.

Game Server: Runs locally, dockerized on your hardware.

Gateway: Runs on a cheap AWS Lightsail instance (provisioned with Terraform).

Tunnel: Traffic is securely tunneled (FRP) from the Cloud to your local.

## System Architecture

    User([Minecraft Client]) -- 1. Resolve Domain --> DNS[DuckDNS Service]
    DNS -- 2. Return Static IP --> User

    subgraph AWS [AWS Lightsail Gateway]
        IP[Static IP]
        FRP_S[FRP Server :7000]
        FW[Lightsail Firewall :25565]
    end

```

## Benefits

- Provides DDoS protection via AWS.
- Low cost (uses cheap cloud compute only for traffic forwarding).
- Hides your home IP address.
- Portable config (Infrastructure as Code).

## Repository Structure

cloud/ - Terraform code to provision the AWS Lightsail Gateway.

local/ - Docker Compose files to run the Minecraft Server & Tunnel Client.

local/config-overrides/ - Game configuration (Whitelists, MOTD, etc.) & additional mods

## Prerequisites

Terraform Installed: sudo apt install terraform

AWS CLI Installed: sudo apt install awscli

Docker & Compose: Installed on your local machine.

DuckDNS Account: A domain (e.g., myserver.duckdns.org) and a Token.

AWS IAM User: With LightsailFullAccess permissions.

## Setup Guide

### Phase 1: The Cloud Gateway (AWS)

1. Configure credentials - Create a (preferably, named) profile for Terraform to use.

```bash
aws configure --profile terraform-lightsail
```

Region: eu-west-2 (or your preference)
Output: json 2. Configure Terraform variables - Create your secret variables file.

```bash
cp cloud/terraform.tfvars.template cloud/terraform.tfvars
```

Edit cloud/terraform.tfvars and add your DuckDNS Token and Domain.

3. Deploy Infrastructure - Terraform will provision the server, install Docker, and start the tunnel server.

```bash
cd cloud
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Verify: The public_ip output matches the IP on your DuckDNS dashboard.

Note: Terraform generates an SSH key (id_rsa.pem) in the cloud/ folder. Keep this private.

### Phase 2: The Game Server (Local)

1. Configure Secrets - set up the tunnel client authentication.

```bash
cd local
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit .env to match the tokens used in Terraform.

2. Configure Game Rules & Whitelist - We use split configuration to keep secrets out of Git.

local/config-overrides/minecraft-public.env: (Commit this) Game rules, MOTD, Difficulty.

local/config-overrides/minecraft-private.env: (GitIgnored) Whitelist, Ops, Sensitive settings.

3. Start the Server

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check Logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

Wait for: Done! (Server Ready) and [ssh] start proxy success (Tunnel Ready).

How to Connect
Server Address: your-domain.duckdns.org

Port: Default (25565) - No port number needed in client.

## Management & Troubleshooting

### SSH Access to Cloud Gateway

Terraform generates a keypair automatically. To debug the cloud server:

```bash
cd cloud
ssh -i id_rsa.pem ubuntu@$(terraform output -raw public_ip)
```

### Managing Players (Ops/Whitelist)

**Do not use in-game commands like /whitelist add as they will be overwritten on restart.**

Edit local/config-overrides/minecraft-private.env.

Add names to OPS= or WHITELIST=.

Apply changes:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### How to Change Modpacks

Switching from one modpack to another (e.g., Vanilla to All The Mods) requires clearing old mod files while preserving your world data.

Stop the server

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Update configuration - edit your docker-compose.yml (or your .env file if you used variables) to point to the new pack.

e.g.
CF_SLUG=better-mc-forge-bmc4 => CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-9. (Verify java version for the docker image in local/docker-compose.yml)
DATA_FOLDER=bmfb4 => atm9

### How to Restore World Backups

Backups are automatically generated by the backup container and stored in local/backups/.

1. Stop the server

```bash
docker-compose down
```

2. Locate the backup

```bash
cd local/backups
ls -lh
```

Example file: 2026-02-08_12-00-00.tgz

3. Move or delete the current world folder to prevent file conflicts.

```bash
cd ../minecraft-data
mv world ../corrupted/
```

OR

```bash
sudo rm -rf world
```

4. Extract the backup

```bash
# Adjust the filename below to match your backup
sudo tar -xzvf ../backups/2026-02-08_12-00-00.tgz -C .
```

5. Fix permissions - Files extracted via sudo are owned by root. The Minecraft container runs as a specific user (UID 1000) and will crash if it cannot read them.

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 .
```

6. Restart server

```bash
cd ..
docker-compose up -d
```

### Common Issues

"Connection Refused": Check if the Tunnel is up (`docker-compose logs frpc`).

"Unknown Host": DNS propagation lag. Wait 5 mins or try the raw IP.

Wrong IP in DuckDNS/Lightsail: Run terraform apply again to force an update.
